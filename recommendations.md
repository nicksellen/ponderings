Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom:
he shows that before there was money, there was debt. For more than 5,000 years, since
the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems

this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors
and creditors.
