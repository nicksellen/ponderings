# the future of the world

*The Future* emcompasses a lot of concepts. Near future, distant future, eventual death of the planet, etc. So to try and get more structure I think some milestones might be useful:

* Time based
  * Next 10 years
  * Next 100 years
  * Next 1000 years
* End of ... (not in any particular order)
  * The planet - sun dies
  * Humanity - we fuck up
* The ultimate end of everything (perhaps called "the universe")

At least one of these seems likely to occur and I imagine all of them might occur.

* The Future We Deserve - 100 essays about the future: http://pediapress.com/books/show/ee265024890e40cbe1f8244087e753/
  * could be interesting, I like this topic
  * collections of essays are easier to read for lazy people like me

So far it seems to be there are 3 ways the future could go:

1. environmental disaster
  * fight for natural resources dominates our time
  * survival of human race itself is in question
  * "progress" is put on hold to attend to more immediate concerns
1. human-created power structures become too powerful (over human freedom)
  * like the world today, but *more*
  * the growth of current power structures - government/business
  * more people are reduced to mere cogs in a system
  * can envisage sum of all human activity as a higher level meta-organism (in the same way all the people in a company can change but the company continues - what *is* the company?)
1. computers take over the world
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity
  * companies taking us in this direction:
    * [Boston Dynamics](http://www.bostondynamics.com/) - the mechanical moving part of the robots (bought by google 2013)
    * [Hanson Robotics](http://www.hansonrobotics.com/) - the bit that relates to humans, emotions, facial expressions, etc
    * [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com/) - the brainy bit (bought by google 2014)
    * [IBM's Watson](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/) - "Watson is built to mirror the same learning process that we have - through the power of cognition"
    * [some quadcopters with fancy algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2itwFJCgFQ) - shows relatively simple physical things being turned into very "organic" moving things with some software and algorithms. The narrator points out: "like all our past creations they may be used to improve the human condition or misused and abused. This is not a technical choice we are faced with, it's a social one."
    * many car companies making [self driving cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car)
    * [exo skeleton suits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=p2W23ysgWKI#t=85)
    * [ipsoft amelia](http://www.ipsoft.com/what-we-do/amelia/) - automated call centre
  * some pretty prominent people have entertained this idea in some form:
    * Alan Turing
    * Ray Kurzweil
    * Stephen Hawking
    * Elon Musk - "With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon" ([washington post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/10/24/elon-musk-with-artificial-intelligence-we-are-summoning-the-demon/))
    * Nick Bostrom
    * "5 Very Smart People Who Think Artificial Intelligence Could Bring the Apocalypse" - http://time.com/3614349/artificial-intelligence-singularity-stephen-hawking-elon-musk/
  * ... and many opponents
    * Paul Allen - http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/
    * http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2013/04/what-should-skeptics-believe-about-the-singularity/
      * don't know if that is opponent of it actually, didn't read it yet
    * http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9252311/the-sheer-stupidity-of-artificial-intelligence/
      * says "A geek religion that aims to exalt machines instead diminishes humanity"

Well, and magic 4th option, the world I actually *want*, I call it the *garden of eden* :) - it looks a bit like [the shire](http://www.travelphotoadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Hobbiton-in-New-Zealand-by-Michael-Matti.jpg) from lord of the rings. A bit more on these in the "perfect new worlds" section below.

Or the *ultimate* end from death of the sun (which would be death of the earth, but maybe humanity has escaped in a magical spaceship by then).

Whichever one will happen first is the one we should fix, if we don't know which one will happen first, we should work on them all, until we have more information.

Maybe there are some other options though, this is probably not *all* the ways the future could go.

The important question is timescale too, is this 1 month (probably not), 1 year, 10 years, 100 years, 1000 years?

## Perfect new worlds

There are a few projects which are trying to push the vision of the world as the beautiful place it could be. I'd love these to happen, I think they need to have an accurate model of the *current* world first. It's one thing to conjure up the magic fairy land in your head, it's another thing entirely to transition our current world into that.

### The Venus Project

https://www.thevenusproject.com/en/

This is a lot to pick through! They are serious!

### The Free World Charter

http://www.freeworldcharter.org/en

It seems blissfully unaware, or at least does not acknowledge, any of the difficulties we face in getting to this dream world. Prefering to state *how things will be*. The [FAQ](http://www.freeworldcharter.org/en/faqs) actually has a lot of the good questions I want to ask, but I'm not convinced by the answers:

> Once people realise there is no longer any real scarcity, and they are a vital part of a community that supports them, greed and selfishness will become unnecessary

> By removing money, you remove the main motivation for greed.

> True incentives to work are passion, flair, helping out, meeting people, wanting to learn. Once money is removed from our lives, people will work with these incentives only

> being free of work and financial constraints would enable you to fulfil your dreams

It would be nice if these things were true. I suspect they are not. Without any actual evidence to back them up I have to fall back on my intuition.

> In a free world, people will also respect each other's entitlement to safe dwelling, privacy and security, because that's how they will be taught from the earliest age

This last bit is most ominous to me: *that's how they will be taught*. What if they disagree? Sounds like the seeds of a dictatorship to me.

I lean towards a darker version where there is fundemental conflict between freedom and the dream world. You can never have both. My vote is for freedom, for a bit of chaos, a bit of crime.

## Institutes, organisations, or campaigns about the future

* [Future of Humanity Institute](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) University of Oxford - *enables a select set of leading intellects to bring the tools of mathematics, philosophy, and science to bear on big-picture questions about humanity and its prospects*
* [Institute for the Future](http://iftf.org/) - *an independent, non-profit research organization with a more than 45-year track record of helping all kinds of organizations make the futures they want*
* [Future of Life Institute](http://futureoflife.org/) - *aimed at keeping AI beneficial to humanity* / *a volunteer-run research and outreach organization working to mitigate existential risks facing humanity. We are currently focusing on potential risks from the development of human-level artificial intelligence*
* [Campaign to Stop Killer Robots](http://www.stopkillerrobots.org/) - *calls for a pre-emptive and comprehensive ban on the development, production, and use of fully autonomous weapons*
* [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org/) - We do foundational mathematical research to ensure smarter-than-human artificial intelligence has a positive impact

## Structural violence

Something about the difference between ideal and current. http://www.structuralviolence.org/structural-violence/. Haven't read it yet.

## Some resources to pick through

    * http://www.iftf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/images/ourwork/Tech_Horizons/2015IFTF_TH_HumanPlusMachine_mapface.jpg
      * a bit more interesting. more from the perspective of how business see's the future though.
    * worth picking their website a bit more though
  * The Millenium Project - http://www.millennium-project.org/ (produces a "State of the Future" report)
    * www.millennium-project.org/millennium/201314SOF.html
      * costs $30. you can keep it mate. anyone wanna give me a copy though?
