# nicks ponderings

This is the home for my ponderings of life. A public collection in my in-progress thoughts on everything. It started just about money but is hopefully expanding to cover all of my thoughts, and some new thoughts I haven't had yet.

## Topics

* [money](money.md) - centered around the morality of money
* [the future](future.md) - what will become of this world (or humanity?)
* [happiness](happiness.md) - what is happiness and how do I get it

## Got something to say?

Discussion happens [over here](https://github.com/nicksellen/ponderings/issues) - I *love* comments/questions, it motivates me to think more.

## Why on github?

The first few people I showed this to thought github is just for code, but:

* git itself (the basis for github) does nothing specifically for code, it's just a versioned tree of binary data
* tracking the progress of my thoughts/ideas through time should hopefully be facinating!
* it allows other people to contribute (should that be a good idea) or at least comment easily
* code people often don't ponder, and ponderers often don't code, perhaps if all the ponderers coded they would use github too
* it's free and works well
* writing in markdown is nice which github supports well, should I wish to turn it into a website, it's pretty trivial
* I use git/github for all my other writing (code that is) so it's handy to share systems
